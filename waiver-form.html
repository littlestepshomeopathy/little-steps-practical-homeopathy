          <p class="waiver-to">To: Jacinta Campbell, Homeopathic Consultant and Educator</p>

          <p>Dear Mrs. Campbell:</p>

          <p>
            I understand that you are a qualified practical homeopath and are knowledgeably
            employing and applying techniques and strategies according to the accepted standards
            of homeopathic practice and pharmacy, and used by homeopathic practitioners worldwide,
            aimed at the alleviation and elimination of acute and chronic disorders applying
            homeopathic principles and restoring health.
          </p>

          <p>
            And, that you may be willing to provide me with particular expert consultations,
            specialized information and services relative to my own particular health condition,
            and/or that of my child, pet, or livestock.
          </p>

          <p>
            I hereby acknowledge and confirm that such information and services as may be provided
            me as a result of this request are expressly agreed to be used for my personal and
            private use and are not to be used for further distribution, and are to be kept strictly
            confidential, and cannot be construed as medical, dental, chiropractic, veterinary
            medical, or any other diagnosis, treatment or advice, or the practice of medicine,
            chiropractic, dentistry, veterinary medicine or pharmacy, or the manufacturing,
            marketing or retailing of drugs.
          </p>

          <p>
            Please be advised, Mrs. Campbell, that I expressly confirm and acknowledge that I am
            fully aware of the fact that you are not in any way professing or holding yourself out
            to be a licensed medical doctor, physician, chiropractor, dentist, veterinarian,
            pharmacist, or any other service or provider &ldquo;Qualified&rdquo; by
            &ldquo;Licensure&rdquo; under any State or Federal Government law, and that you charge
            only for the time, care, and expertise necessary for such private consultations.
          </p>

          <p>
            Furthermore, take note that I am fully aware of, and do hereby willfully acknowledge
            to agree to the fact that, any and all services and information you may choose to
            provide me is in direct response to this personal private request only, and that in no
            way can such an exchange of services or information between us be considered a
            solicitation of services, funds, or any other offering of any sort or kind on your
            part, and I alone am fully responsible for how I use the information obtained, and any
            treatments or remedies I decided to take myself or administer to my children, animals,
            livestock, or plants.
          </p>

          <p>
            Additionally, I hereby agree to pay you fully the fees required for such services, and
            expressly admit that I have not requested such services and information solely for the
            purposes of &ldquo;inquiry&rdquo;, but in an honest and legitimate attempt to ascertain
            the validity of your strategies to restore my or my family&rsquo;s, or my pet&rsquo;s,
            livestock&rsquo;s or plant&rsquo;s health relative to one or more specific health
            conditions, and in consideration of further partaking of the services made available
            through yourself.
          </p>
