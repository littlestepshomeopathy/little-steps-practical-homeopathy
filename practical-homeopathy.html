        <h2>An Educational Approach</h2>
        <p>
          Practical homeopathy is an educational approach that helps individuals and
          families learn how homeopathic remedies have traditionally been used to
          support wellness in everyday life.
        </p>
        <p>
          Rather than focusing on disease labels, this approach emphasizes observation,
          patterns, and thoughtful learning.
