        <h2>What Is Practical Homeopathy?</h2>
        <p>
          Practical homeopathy is an educational approach that helps individuals and families
          learn how homeopathic remedies have traditionally been used to support wellness.
        </p>
        <p>
          Rather than focusing on disease labels, this approach emphasizes observation,
          patterns, and thoughtful learning.
