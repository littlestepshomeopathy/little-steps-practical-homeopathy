        <h2>Hello, I'm Glad You're Here</h2>
        <p>
          I am a trained Practical Homeopath (PHom), having completed professional
          education through the Academy of Practical Homeopathy.
        </p>
        <p>
          My passion is supporting mothers and families as they learn how to
          confidently use practical homeopathy in their homes.
        </p>
        <p>
          My approach is gentle, respectful, and rooted in education. Sessions focus
          on understanding, learning, and empowerment &mdash; never diagnosis or medical
          treatment.
